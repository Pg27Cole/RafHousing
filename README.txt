#HOW TO USE:

To run this you need to open both the backend and frontend folders in the command prompt. From there you need to run the command 'npm run dev' for both. 
following this you should be able to copy the URL from the frontend cmd window and paste it into google. 

#WHAT I ADDED: 
I added the leaderboard data component, the contact page, the input component, and I changed how the leaderboardSummary works

#ISSUES:
I did not identify any bugs, however all of the data is completely fabricated, none of it means anything. 
Moreover, the backend doesnt save the user feedback into a file right now.
